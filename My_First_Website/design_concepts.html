            <h2>Basic Design Concepts</h2>
            <p>Here are a few basic design concepts to keep in mind. I'll add some more when as I discover them. 
        </div>
        <nav role="navigation">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="web_development_cheatbook.html" title="Frontpage">Frontpage</a></li>
                <li><a href="attributes.html" title="Attributes">Element Attributes</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
        
        <table class="image">
            <tr><td><img src="_images/Basic%20Website%20Model.PNG" width="80%" alt="Basic Model"></td></tr>
            <tr><td class="caption"><h4>Basic Web Design Model</h4></td></tr>    
        </table>
        <p>This is the most basic of basic layouts out there. I have been more or less using this model to build this website. Each section is laid out in the way shown above and each section has tags associated with it. This is a good place to start when designing a webpage. <i>Image provided by James Williamson in a LinkedIn Learning lecture called Essential HTML Training.</i></p>
        
        <table class="image">
            <tr><td><img src="_images/Code%20Relationships.jpg" width="80%" alt="Code Relationships"></td></tr>
            <tr><td class="caption"><h4>Code Relationships</h4></td></tr>    
        </table>
        <p>This is the basic relationship between the three core web development languages. HTML forms the base and is the minmimun requirement for what makes a website.</p>
        
        <p> Even without any provided style and scripting pages will function with HTML alone. A page without CSS is not unstyled however, it will be styled using a default style provided by the browser the page is running in.</p>
        
        <p>CSS provides the style, naturally. The look and feel of a website is provided by CSS. Websites without there own stylesheets, are simply put, unstylish.</p>
        
        <p>Javascript provides something above and beyond style and structure. In short, Javascript can do anything but generally speaking Javascript is the final layer that takes the stuff provided by HTML and CSS and cuts it up, rearranges it and transforms it. Javascript can even add HTML and CSS information with script! This stuff is really magical.</p>
